# DSA-implementation

This repository contains my implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C++. The code is organized into four folders, each corresponding to a different topic:

- **Stacks, Queues, and Lists**: This folder contains the implementations of linear data structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists, circular lists, and doubly linked lists. These data structures allow insertion and deletion of elements at specific positions.
- **Sorting, Searching, and Hashing**: This folder contains the implementations of algorithms for sorting, searching, and hashing data. Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a certain order, such as ascending or descending. Searching algorithms find an element in a collection of data, such as linear search or binary search. Hashing algorithms map data to a fixed-size value, such as hash tables or bloom filters.
- **Trees**: This folder contains the implementations of tree data structures and algorithms. Trees are hierarchical data structures that consist of nodes and edges. Some examples of trees are binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, and heaps. Tree algorithms perform operations on trees, such as traversal, insertion, deletion, and balancing.
- **Graphs**: This folder contains the implementations of graph data structures and algorithms. Graphs are data structures that consist of vertices and edges. Some examples of graphs are directed graphs, undirected graphs, weighted graphs, and adjacency lists. Graph algorithms perform operations on graphs, such as traversal, shortest path, minimum spanning tree, and topological sorting.

## How to run the code

To run the code in this repository, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can use any IDE or text editor of your choice to edit the code. To compile and run the code from the command line, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the folder that contains the code file you want to run.
- Type `g++ -o output filename.cpp` to compile the code, where `output` is the name of the executable file and `filename.cpp` is the name of the code file.
- Type `./output` to run the executable file and see the output.
