# DSA Implementation

This repository contains my implementation of various data structures and algorithms (DSA) in C++. The code is organized according to the topics covered in my DSA course syllabus.

## Stacks, Queues, and Lists

This folder contains the implementation of stack, queue, and linked list data structures. The code files are as follows:

- [`Stacks.cpp`](Stacks,%20Queues,%20and%20Lists/Stacks.cpp): Implementation of a stack using an array.
- [`Queues.cpp`](Stacks,%20Queues,%20and%20Lists/Queues.cpp): Implementation of a queue using an array.
- [`CircularQueues.cpp`](Stacks,%20Queues,%20and%20Lists/CircularQueues.cpp): Implementation of a circular queue using an array.
- [`PriorityQueues.cpp`](Stacks,%20Queues,%20and%20Lists/PriorityQueues.cpp): Implementation of a priority queue using an array.
- [`Deques.cpp`](Stacks,%20Queues,%20and%20Lists/Deques.cpp): Implementation of a double ended queue using an array.
- [`LinkedLists.cpp`](Stacks,%20Queues,%20and%20Lists/LinkedLists.cpp): Implementation of a singly linked list.
- [`StackLinkedLists.cpp`](Stacks,%20Queues,%20and%20Lists/StackLinkedLists.cpp): Implementation of a stack using linked list.
- [`QueueLinkedLists.cpp`](Stacks,%20Queues,%20and%20Lists/QueueLinkedLists.cpp): Implementation of a queue using linked list.
- [`DoublyLinkedLists.cpp`](Stacks,%20Queues,%20and%20Lists/DoublyLinkedLists.cpp): Implementation of a doubly linked list.

## Sorting, Searching, and Hashing

This folder contains the implementation of sorting, searching, and hashing algorithms. The code files are as follows:

- `Sorting.cpp`: Implementation of various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, etc.
- `Searching.cpp`: Implementation of various searching algorithms such as linear search, binary search, etc.
- `Hashing.cpp`: Implementation of hash tables and hashing algorithms.

## Trees and Graphs

This folder contains the implementation of tree and graph data structures. The code files are as follows:

- `BinaryTree.cpp`: Implementation of a binary tree data structure.
- `AVLTree.cpp`: Implementation of an AVL tree data structure.
- `Graph.cpp`: Implementation of a graph data structure.

Feel free to explore the code files in each folder to understand the implementation details. You can use this repository as a reference for your DSA studies or as a starting point for your own projects.
